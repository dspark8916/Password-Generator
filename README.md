## The Importance of a Strong Password

    Strong passwords are utterly important – they prevent unauthorized access to your electronic accounts and devices.

    If you choose a very complicated and long password, you will make it very difficult for a hacker to crack it, whether by a brute-force attack (trying every possible combination of numbers, letters or special characters) or an automated machine attack trying thousands of combinations per second to guess your one and only.

    So, the more complex your password is, the more security it provides for your account. Remember that your account is where you store a great deal of sensitive information that you don’t want to have stolen. As you understand, the stakes are very high. Therefore, taking care of your account password is crucial.
